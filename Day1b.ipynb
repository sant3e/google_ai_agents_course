    "> **Question:** How does the research agent know what to research since I don't see anything passed from the root agent?  \n",
    "> **Question:** How does the root agent access the final summary from the summarizer agent?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Research Agent and Question Passing**\n",
    "\n",
    "When the root agent calls `AgentTool(research_agent)`, the **original user question** is automatically passed to the research agent. The ADK framework handles this behind the scenes - it doesn't need to be explicitly stated in the instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The flow is:\n",
    "1. User asks: \"What are the latest advancements managing PII data for a Snowflake Data Warehouse?\"\n",
    "2. Root agent receives this question\n",
    "3. Root agent calls `AgentTool(research_agent)` \n",
    "4. ADK automatically passes the original question to the research_agent\n",
    "5. Research agent uses google_search with that question\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Summarizer Agent and AgentTool**\n",
    "\n",
    "You're correct that the summarizer agent doesn't use `AgentTool(research_agent)`. Here's why:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Research Agent** is a tool that the root agent uses\n",
    "- **Summarizer Agent** is also a tool that the root agent uses\n",
    "- Neither needs to use AgentTool because they're not calling other agents\n",
    "\n",
    "The summarizer gets its input through the `{research_findings}` placeholder in its instruction, which ADK automatically replaces with the research agent's output.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Root Agent Accessing Final Results**\n",
    "\n",
    "You're also right to question how the root agent accesses the summarizer's final output. This happens through ADK's state management:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Research agent outputs to `research_findings` key\n",
    "2. Summarizer agent reads from `{research_findings}` and outputs to `final_summary` key\n",
    "3. Root agent can access `final_summary` in its context after the summarizer runs\n",
    "\n",
    "The root agent's instruction says \"present the final summary clearly to the user\" - ADK makes the `final_summary` available to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why This Design Works\n",
    "\n",
    "This design separates:\n",
    "- **Tool agents** (research, summarizer) that do specific tasks\n",
    "- **Coordinator agent** (root) that orchestrates the workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "The coordinator doesn't need to know the internal details of how tools work - it just needs to know when to call them and what to do with their results."
