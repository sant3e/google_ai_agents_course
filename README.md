# 5-Day AI Agents Intensive Course with Google

This repository contains my personal implementations and notes from the 5-Day AI Agents Intensive Course developed by Google's ML researchers and engineers.

## Course Overview

The 5-Day AI Agents Intensive is an online course designed to help developers explore the foundations and practical applications of AI agents. The course covers:

- Core components of AI agents: models, tools, orchestration, memory, and evaluation
- How agents move beyond LLM prototypes to become production-ready systems
- Hands-on examples, codelabs, and practical implementations

## Resources

- [Agent Development Kit](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/) - Official documentation for Google's Agent Development Kit

## Repository Content

This repository follows the course structure with my own versions of the Jupyter notebooks for each day:

- **Day 1**: Introduction to AI Agents fundamentals
  - `Day1a.ipynb` - First part of Day 1 exercises
  - `Day1b.ipynb` - Second part of Day 1 exercises

## Learning Goals

By the end of this course, you'll be able to:
- Build, evaluate, and deploy AI agents that solve real-world problems
- Understand the architecture and components of production-ready AI agents
- Implement practical AI agent solutions using modern tools and frameworks

## Note

These notebooks represent my personal learning journey through the course material, adapted with my own implementations and approaches to the exercises and examples provided.
