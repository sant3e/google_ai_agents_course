    "## What is an AI Agent?\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of an AI agent as a **smart assistant** that can:\n",
    "- **Understand** your requests (like a chatbot)\n",
    "- **Think** about how to respond (using an LLM)\n",
    "- **Act** on your behalf (using tools like search, calculations, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you ask a personal assistant: \"What's the weather in London?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understanding**: The assistant understands you want weather information\n",
    "2. **Thinking**: They realize they need current weather data\n",
    "3. **Acting**: They check a weather app or website\n",
    "4. **Responding**: They tell you \"It's 15°C and cloudy in London\"\n",
    "\n",
    "An AI agent does the same thing, but with code instead of a person!\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Google's ADK?\n",
    "\n",
    "**ADK (Agent Development Kit)** is Google's framework for building AI agents. It provides:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pre-built components** for common agent tasks\n",
    "- **Integration** with Google's Gemini models\n",
    "- **Tools** like Google Search, code execution, and more\n",
    "- **Structure** for organizing complex agent behaviors\n",
