    "So far, you have learned how to create custom functions for your agents. But connecting to external systems (GitHub, databases, Slack) requires writing and maintaining API clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard that lets agents use community-built integrations. Instead of writing your own integrations and API clients, just connect to an existing MCP server.\n",
    "\n",
    "MCP enables agents to:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Access live, external data** from databases, APIs, and services without custom integration code  \n",
    "✅ **Leverage community-built tools** with standardized interfaces  \n",
    "✅ **Scale capabilities** by connecting to multiple specialized servers\n",
    "### 2.1: How MCP Works\n",
    "\n",
    "MCP connects your agent (the **client**) to external **MCP servers** that provide tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MCP Server**: Provides specific tools (like image generation, database access)\n",
    "- **MCP Client**: Your agent that uses those tools\n",
    "- **All servers work with the same way** - standardized interface\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture\n",

    "### 2.2: Using MCP with Your Agent\n",

    "The workflow is simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose an MCP Server and tool\n",
    "2. Create an MCP Toolset (configure connection)\n",
    "3. Add it to your agent\n",

    "- Returns `{'status': 'pending', ...}` immediately\n",
    "- **ADK automatically creates `adk_request_confirmation` event**\n",
    "- Agent execution pauses - waiting for human decision\n",

    "**Scenario 3: Large order - RESUMED CALL**\n",
    "- Tool detects it's resuming: `if not tool_context.tool_confirmation:` is now False\n",

    "- If True → Returns approved status\n",
    "- If False → Returns rejected status\n",
